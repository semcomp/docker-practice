# Docker Practice

It's a simple repository with baby-steps suggestions to learn docker hands on.

It assumes that you already have the [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (or equivalent)
installed on your machine.

Don't forget to enable and start the Docker Daemon if needed (check the
[install instructions for your SO/distro](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)).

For convenience, add your user to the `docker` group, so you don't need to include
`sudo` before every command:

```
[sudo] gpasswd -a yourusername docker
```
